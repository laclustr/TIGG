# TIGG
TI Game Guide, or TIGG, is Laclustr's guide to putting games on the TI-83 and TI-84 calculators. This guide includes the color editions (CE) and plus editions as well.

Before you begin, please ensure you have the USB cable required to connect your calculator to connect your calculator to your computer.

Step 1. 

Download the TI Connect CE software from the official Texas Instruments website.
This software works with all TI calculators including non-CE calculators and is the most updated.

Windows - https://education.ti.com/download/en/ed-tech/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/E83C88A7C19B4D0C87429F5C1CDDD4D6/TIConnectCE-6.0.0.2688.msi


Step 2. 

Check the version of your calculator OS by pressing the '2nd' key as well as the '+' key. Next, press the '1' key, directly below the edition of your calculator should be a number in this format 'x.x.x.xxxx'. If the first two numbers are '5.4' or less, skip to step X. If the number is '5.5' or greater, proceed to step 3.


Step 3.

For CE calculators, proceed to step 3a. For non-CE calculators proceed to step 3b.


Step 3a.

Proceed to 'https://github.com/laclustr/TIGG/blob/main/arTIfiCE.8xv' and download the file. Next, proceed to 'https://github.com/laclustr/TIGG/blob/main/cesium.8xp' and download that file. Open the TI Connect CE application. Then, click on the icon that appears to be a stack of papers. Drag and drop the two files you just downloaded onto the grey and white lines.
