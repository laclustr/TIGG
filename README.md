TI Game Guide, or TIGG, is Laclustr's guide to putting games on the TI-83 and TI-84 calculators. This guide includes the color editions (CE) and plus editions as well. This doesn't include the special editions (SE) however. Any questions or comments, shoot me an email at ret.45ds@gmail.com.

Before you begin, please ensure you have the USB cable required to connect your calculator to connect your calculator to your computer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2. 

Check the version of your calculator OS by pressing the '2nd' key as well as the '+' key. Next, press the '1' key, directly below the edition of your calculator should be a number in this format 'x.x.x.xxxx'.
For CE Calculators - If the first two numbers are '5.4' or less, skip to step 4. If the number is '5.5' or greater, proceed to step 3.
For non-CE Calculators - Proceed to step 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3.

For CE calculators, proceed to step 3a. For non-CE calculators proceed to step 3b.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3a.

Connect your calculator to your computer via a USB cable. Then proceed to 'https://github.com/laclustr/TIGG/blob/main/Jailbreak/CE%20Calculators/arTIfiCE.8xv' and download the file. Next, proceed to 'https://github.com/laclustr/TIGG/blob/main/Jailbreak/CE%20Calculators/cesium.8xp' and download that file. Open the TI Connect CE application. Then, click on the icon that appears to be a stack of papers. Drag and drop the two files you just downloaded onto the grey and white lines. Click the blue send button at the bottom of the popup and proceed to the calculator. Next, download the libraries file and unzip it 'https://github.com/laclustr/TIGG/blob/main/Libraries/CE%20Calculators/Libraries.zip'. Drag and drop them onto the same grey and white lines as before. Click the same blue send button at the bottom of the popup and proceed to the calculator. Press the apps button on the calculator, then use the arrow keys to navigate down to the app that is named CabriJr. Click enter twice. If a menu appears, don't press anything. Otherwise, click the 'y=' button. Navigate to the open button and click enter twice. You are halfway through! Navigate to where it says Cesium and press enter. It may take a minute to appear but the app should say 'Installed in [apps] menu'. Press 'clear' twice and then 'mode'. You have successfully jailbroken a calculator! Proceed to step 4.

Step 3b.

Connect your calculator to your computer via a USB cable. Then proceed to 'https://github.com/laclustr/TIGG/blob/main/Jailbreak/Non-CE%20Calculators/ion.83g' and download the file. Next, proceed to 'https://github.com/laclustr/TIGG/blob/main/Jailbreak/Non-CE%20Calculators/ion.8xg' and download that file. Open the TI Connect CE application. Then, click on the icon that appears to be a stack of papers. Drag and drop the two files you just downloaded onto the grey and white lines. Click the blue send button at the bottom of the popup and proceed to the calculator. On the calculator, press the 'prgm' button. Run the 'ION' program. Once it installs,

Step 4. 

Scroll to the top of the page. Click on the games folder and click on your calculator model. Download any of the games you may enjoy. Be mindful of how many games you download as your calculator can only support around 30 games tops. Additionally, ensure you have downloaded all of the files within a game folder, if it doesn't come bundled with other files then you may skip this step. Then, open the TI Connect CE app. Once you've done that, drag and drop the files onto the same place you dropped them in the previous steps. Before hitting send, ensure the dropdown menu says archive to permanently store your games. Congrats! You have successfully put games on your calculator.

Step 5. 

For CE calculators (Those who did step 3a) - Go to the homepage of your calculator. Next press the 'on' and 'pgrm' keys at the same time. Navigate to the game you'd like to play and click enter. Your calculator is now game ready.

For Non-CE calculators (Those who did step 3b) -
